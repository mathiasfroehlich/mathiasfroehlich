# Hi, I’m Mathias Fröhlich  
_Innsbruck, Austria_

I enjoy crafting small, purpose-driven tools — with a focus on clear logic and well-designed interfaces.  
This space is my personal lab for side projects, experiments, and ideas in motion.

I’m also inspired by the clarity and restraint of classic desktop design — blending those first principles with modern tooling and aesthetics.

---

## I like to work with:
- TypeScript / React / Blazor  
- .NET / Go / PostgreSQL  
- Interfaces that feel intuitive and considered

---

## Projects (selected)
- **Kredit-Prognose Tool**  
  A simple, visual way to track your loan repayment journey.

- **Guitar Scale Generator**  
  A hands-on fretboard calculator that outputs laser-ready templates.

- **Real Estate Dashboard**  
  A concise, data-driven view of housing prices over time.

- **Vintage Desktop Dotfiles** *(in progress)*  
  A personal setup that fuses timeless interface principles with today’s developer workflows.

---

## Notes
- Some projects are small experiments; others grow at their own pace.  
- All are crafted to teach me something new.
